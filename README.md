## Backend

The backend is created using Python3 and Postgres, and it can be installed and run locally, we used Ubunutu to configure and build the database

## Setup 
Before getting started, Postgres needs to be installed locally, to do so on Ubuntu: 
`sudo apt-get install postgres postgres-contrib`

Run the local server using:
`sudo service postgresql start`

You can verify your postgres server is online with:
`pg_lsclusters`

The an admin role has to be added to the db, to do this, become the postgres user using:
`sudo su postgres` 

Next, get into the psql shell with the following command: 
`psql`

To create a user, do: 
`CREATE USER admin WITH PASSWORD '123';`
`ALTER USER admin WITH SUPERUSER;` 

By doing this, the database should be configured correctly with how it is set up the in code. 

## Create Tables
In the root of the project (local) run the following command to ensure all required modules are installed:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

The tables can be created locally by running:
`python server/dbfunctions/create_tables.py`
running this file will create the databases required for this project

After this, everything in the database should be configured, to run the main database routine to scrape ads from websites, run:
`python server/server_main.py`
